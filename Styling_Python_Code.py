#PYTHON CRASH COURSE Chapter#3

#When changes will be made to the Python language, they write a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)
#The oldest PEPs is PEP8 which instructs programmers on how to style their code.
#Code will be read more often then its written. 
#You will write your code and then read it to debug. The idea is that you should be able to read and understand others code. 
#Choice between code that is easier to write or code that easier to read, you will be encouraged to write code that's easier to read.

#TO OPEN UP A HYPERLINK to PEP8, see the code below at python.org .

#Indentations
#########################
#PEP8 recommends that you use 4 space per indentation
#In a word processing doc or text editor the tab uses the 4 spaces. 
#The Python interpreter will throw errors if tabs are mixed with spaces.
#You can convert tabs into spaces in most editors to debug. 

#########################
#Line Length
#########################
#Programmers recommends aht each line should be less than 80 characters.
#This guideline comes because most computers could only fit 79 characters on a single line.
#PEP 8 recommends to limit comments to 72 characters per line since some tools that generate auto documentation will add characters at the beginner of each commented line.
#You can set up a visual cue, usually a vertical line on your screen to show the character limits.

#########################
#Blank Lines
#########################
#To group parts of your programs, use blank lines. 
#Blank lines do not effect how the code runs. They affect the readability. 
#The Python interpreter uses horizontal indentation to interpet the code, but disregards vertical spacing.
